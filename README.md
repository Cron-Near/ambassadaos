## Purpose

To further the growth of DAOs by allowing DAOs to coordinate collaboration, resources & experiments in ways that wouldn't be possible with a single DAO.
To bring together a daoverse group of communities, where each has equal voice to innovate and inspire the next iteration of DAO interactivity.

## What is this repo?

The following code folders exist as a framework for creating & maintaining multi-daos. Currently there are no tools to aid the MultiDAO concept, so this repo will be a way for testing the theory and thoughts of multi-DAOs.
This repo also stems from experiments between croncat and other DAOs, and was included as a talk for Nearcon Alpha. You can checkout the [slides for that talk here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QtyyE6VuHWyzwkyl8dAKCWZYMBx-y0viSIJmuen67f4/edit?usp=sharing).

## MultiDAO Use Cases

- [x] Ephemeral DAO - DAOs that exist for single or small purposes of coordination/effort, and are short lived, potentially only existing for days - weeks.
- [x] Competition/Collaboration - A multidao consisting of separate communities coming together for a common goal, coalition, objective or chivalrous rivalry.
- [x] Politics - Representations of diverse DAOs communicating structured oppinions for change or movement within the ecosystem.
- [x] Foundation - Resource based multi-DAO allowing DAO council to orchestrate funding of initiatives or bounties.
- [x] Sub-DAO - (To Be Confirmed as either a group within a DAO or a full DAO within a DAO) A sub-DAO allows grouped types of community individuals to unite and collaborate within a larger DAO but remain focussed on their sub-DAO niche. Think of sub-DAOs as departments in an organization.

## Demo DAO: Multidaomo

To test each feature of the multidao, a simple demo DAO with few members will be used to test all types of proposals and ideas before going the main multidao. Consider this DAO the "staging" of multidaos.

## Main DAO: Ambassadaos
